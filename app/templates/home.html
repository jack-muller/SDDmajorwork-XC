    <h2>A Brief History of GPS XC</h2>
    <p>
        The GPS (Great Public Schools) Cross Country competition is a storied tradition, bringing together the finest young 
        athletes from some of the most prestigious schools in the region. Established over a century ago, the competition 
        has evolved from humble beginnings into a highly anticipated event on the school sports calendar. Each year, 
        athletes push their limits, not just for personal glory but also for the pride of their schools.
